## Setup for local development

- run React in dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

We use HTTPS with a [self-signed SSL certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate) when run React in dev mode, so the browser probably will show `Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead`. You need to press on `Accept the Risk and Continue`(the text may be different) button:
