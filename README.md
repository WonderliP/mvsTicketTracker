## Setup for local development

- build the React app
```bash
npm run build
```

- run a local web-server
```bash
npm run serve:static
```

- add and run the script that adds the built app to the HTML page

The script is located [here](./src/addReact/addReact.js).  

The script can be added as a bookmark. 

For testing purpose, the script can be tested on a local HTML page - [index.html](./src/addReact/index.html).
